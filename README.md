ATP reaction-diffusion with mitochondrial agents

Several preliminary experiments: 1) random positioned mitos, ATP consumed everywhere; 2) clustered mitos, ATP consumed everywhere; 3) random positioned mitos, ATP consumed in central region.

Nuances: physical values for cellular ATP concentration (given 2D picture, need to assume a thickness, maybe 10um), reasonable values for total ATP consumption rate, diffusion; how much ATP gradient exists at equilibrium? Need concentration around 1mM; consumption rate around 10^9 molecules / s. Control parameters: consumption rate constant, production rate constant per mito. Hard to find a combination that supports a large gradient while hitting those values.
